# Changelog

## 30/08/2019
### Added
- To the changelog finally, sorry I forgot about all this.
- Additional specs for `Vec2` class
- Added `cross` to `Vec3` class, static as well
- Added a bunch of common operations and methods to the `Vec4` class
  - Definitely need a parent class of some sort here.

### Update
- Update to `Vec3` class for `limit` method, looking like a parent abstraction isn't a base idea

### Notes
- Matrix and Vector classes may need abstract parents, will think on this.
