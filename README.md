**WORK IN PROGRESS**: A collection of mathematical constructs, functions, types and utilities to assist in working with the following:

- Scalar values
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Polar Coordinates
- Geometry

Please note that this is still currently under construction, I will publish this to *npm* as soon as it is ready and I am moderately happy with it :)
